## I am **Tony Ko**, Front End Developer with experience in design.

I currently specialize in **Front End: Gulp.js, Node.js, Express.js, Algorithms, Responsive CSS / Frameworks**, but I also often get my hands dirty with back end skills in **Hugo static site generation, Node.js, Python, Wordpress and Docker & Linux**.

**For almost a decade**, I have been fascinated with the idea of working with front-end technologies, magic and possibilities of software.

**For the last year**, I have focused my efforts to fully develop this desire into a complete career.

As a whole, I hope to bring a unique **developer-designer** perspective to my work.
