# Personal Project - OCAD Prospective Student Porfolio
"Alfred Wong" is known for his philanthropist work in the art sector. With his company’s design expertise, "Alfred" wishes to pursue his personal interest in modern design. He is particularly interested in the minimalist style of design. Recently, he acquired 3 famous sculptures and though simple in nature, "Alfred" admires the elegance of these sculptures and wishes to increase public interest via his own personal gallery.

## Personal Note:
This sculpture gallery project is created as one of the pieces in the OCAD Prospective Student Portfolio. It was the amalgamation of the best knowledge and skills I had the time.

## Project Criteria:
* Personal sculpture gallery to reflect and display 3 sculptures to guests.
* Gallery also serves as personal residential space and is built in harmony with nature and landscape.
