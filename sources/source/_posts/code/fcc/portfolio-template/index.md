# Student Project - Free Code Camp
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/

## Project Criteria:
* User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
* User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
* User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
* User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
