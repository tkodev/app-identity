## 3 - Use the Twitchtv JSON API
### Complete
* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.
* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
* User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
* Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
* Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.
* Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
* UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.hyperdev.space/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
* Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
* When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
* You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
